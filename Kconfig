config SCRIPTS
	bool "enable pre and postinstall scripts"
	default y
	help
	  Enabling this option, the installer will run
	  pre- and postinstall scripts, if they are present
	  in the image. For security reason, this option
	  can be switched off.

config HW_COMPATIBILITY
	bool "check for hardware / software compatibility"
	default n
	help
	  If enabled, check if the hardware revision
	  supports the softwrae version. Detecting the hardware
	  revision is very board specific, and it cannot be generalized.
	  For this reason, the software expects that the detected
	  version is written into a file by a previous software.

config HW_COMPATIBILITY_FILE
	string "File with detected hardare revisions"
	depends on HW_COMPATIBILITY
	default "/etc/hwrevision"
	help
	  File where to read the detected hardware revsion
	  that must be compared with the software version.
	  The file has simple entries (one per line) in the
	  format of "major.minor".

config MTD
	bool "MTD support"
	default y
	help
	  Enable MTD support.

config LUA

	  Enable LUA interpreter.

config STATIC
	bool "Build swupdate as a static binary (no shared libs)"
	default n
	help
	  If you want to build a static BusyBox binary, which does not
	  use or require any shared libraries, then enable this option.
	  This can cause BusyBox to be considerably larger, so you should
	  leave this option false unless you have a good reason (i.e.
	  your target platform does not support shared libraries, or
	  you are building an initrd which doesn't need anything but
	  BusyBox, etc).

	  Most people will leave this set to 'N'.

config CROSS_COMPILE
	string "Cross Compiler prefix"
	default ""
	help
	  If you want to build BusyBox with a cross compiler, then you
	  will need to set this to the cross-compiler prefix, for example,
	  "i386-uclibc-".

	  Native builds leave this empty.

config SYSROOT
	string "Path to sysroot"
	default ""
	help
	  If you want to build BusyBox with a cross compiler, then you
	  might also need to specify where /usr/include and /usr/lib
	  will be found.

	  For example, BusyBox can be built against an installed
	  Android NDK, platform version 9, for ARM ABI with

	  CONFIG_SYSROOT=/opt/android-ndk/platforms/android-9/arch-arm

	  Native builds leave this empty.

config EXTRA_CFLAGS
	string "Additional CFLAGS"
	default ""
	help
	  Additional CFLAGS to pass to the compiler verbatim.

config EXTRA_LDFLAGS
	string "Additional LDFLAGS"
	default ""
	help
	  Additional LDFLAGS to pass to the linker verbatim.

config EXTRA_LDLIBS
	string "Additional LDLIBS"
	default ""
	help
	  Additional LDLIBS to pass to the linker with -l.

menu 'Debugging Options'

config DEBUG
	bool "Build Swupdate with extra Debugging symbols"
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you wish to examine BusyBox internals while applets are
	  running. This increases the size of the binary considerably, and
	  should only be used when doing development. If you are doing
	  development and want to debug BusyBox, answer Y.

	  Most people should answer N.

config DEBUG_PESSIMIZE
	bool "Disable compiler optimizations"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG
	help
	  The compiler's optimization of source code can eliminate and reorder
	  code, resulting in an executable that's hard to understand when
	  stepping through it with a debugger. This switches it off, resulting
	  in a much bigger executable that more closely matches the source
	  code.

config WERROR
	bool "Abort compilation on any warning"
	default n
	help
	  Selecting this will add -Werror to gcc command line.

	  Most people should answer N.

config NOCLEANUP
	bool "Do not remove temporary files after execution"
	default n
	help
	  After each run, temporary files are removed from
	  /tmp to restart in a clean state. For debugging purpose,
	  it helps to check the consistency of the file extracted
	  by swupdate.
	  For production, answer N.

config DOWNLOAD
	bool "Enable image downloading"
	default n
	help
	  Enable update from image URL using libcurl. Files are downloaded
	  completely before installation begins.

config WEBSERVER
	bool "Enable webserver"
	default n
	help
	  Enable update from remote using a webserver on the target.
