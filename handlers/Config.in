config UBIVOL
	bool "ubivol"
	default n
	depends on HAVE_LIBUBI
	depends on MTD
	help
	  ubi is the default format for NAND device.
	  Say Y if you have NAND or you use UBI on
	  your system.

comment "ubivol support needs libubi"
	depends on !HAVE_LIBUBI

config UBIBLACKLIST
	string "List of MTD devices to be excluded for UBI"
	depends on UBIVOL
	help
	  Define a list of MTD devices that are excluded
	  by scan_mtd_device. The devices are still available
	  as raw devices.
	  The list can be set as a string with the mtd numbers.
	  Examples: "0 1 2"
	  This excludes mtd0-mtd1-mtd2 to be searched for UBI volumes

config UBIVIDOFFSET
	int "VID Header Offset"
	depends on UBIVOL
	default 0
	help
	  Force UBI to set a VID header offset to be 2048 bytes
	  instead of the value reported by the kernel.
	  In other words, you may ask UBI to avoid using sub-pages.
	  This is not recommended since this will require
	  more storage overhead, but may be useful
	  if your NAND driver incorrectly reports that it can handle
	  sub-page accesses when it should not.


config CFI
	bool "cfi"
	depends on MTD
	default n
	help
	  Handler to store images in flash in raw mode,
	  without UBI

config CFIHAMMING1
	bool "NAND in raw mode with 1bit Hamming OOB (TI)"
	depends on MTD
	default n
	select CFI
	help
	  On certain TI's omaps (for example, DM3730 or AM3517),
	  the first bootloader (MLO or SPL) must be saved with one bit
	  Hamming correction because this is requested by the SOC's ROM.
	  However, the Linux driver must use for the rest of the NAND a more
	  powerful algorithm to make data reliable, and this causes that
	  it is not possible to update SPL by letting the driver to handle
	  the OOB area. This handler raws the NAND in raw mode, computing
	  the ECC with 1 bit Hamming Code and saving it into OOB
	  (assumes sector size of 512 and page size of 2048).

	  You do not need this if you have not a OMAP SOC.

config RAW
	bool "raw"
	default n
	help
	  This is a simple handler that simply copies
	  into the destination.

config LUASCRIPTHANDLER
	bool "luascript"
	depends on LUA
	default n
	help
	  Handler to be called for pre- and post scripts
	  written in LUA.

config SHELLSCRIPTHANDLER
	bool "shellscript"
	default n
	help
	  Handler to be called for pre- and post scripts
	  written as shell scripts. The default shell /bin/sh
	  is called.

config HANDLER_IN_LUA
	bool "Handlers in LUA"
	depends on LUASCRIPTHANDLER
	default n
	help
	  Allow to write own handlers in LUA.
	  They are loaded at the start-up.

config ARCHIVE
	bool "archive"
	depends on HAVE_LIBARCHIVE
	default n
	help
	  Handler using the libarchive to extract tarballs
	  into a filesystem.

config UBOOT
	bool "uboot"
	depends on HAVE_ZLIB
	default n
	help
	  Enable it to change U-Boot environment
	  during the installation process.

comment "uboot support needs libz"
	depends on !HAVE_ZLIB

config UBOOT_FWENV
	string "U-Boot Environment Configuration file"
	depends on UBOOT
	default "/etc/fw_env.config"
	help
	  This is the file described in U-Boot documentation
	  in the tools directory. It tells to the user space
	  where U-Boot environment is saved, that is, on which
	  MTD device.
