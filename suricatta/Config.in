menuconfig SURICATTA
	bool "Suricatta"
	help
	  Suricatta is a daemon mode of SWUpdate.

	  Suricatta regularly polls a remote server for updates,
	  downloads, and installs them. Thereafter, it reboots the
	  system and reports the update status to the server, based
	  on an update state variable currently stored in bootloader’s
	  environment ensuring persistent storage across reboots. Some
	  U-Boot script logics or U-Boot’s bootcount feature may be
	  utilized to alter this update state variable, e.g., by
	  setting it to reflect failure in case booting the newly
	  flashed root file system has failed and a switchback had to
	  be performed.
